Project Overview
AtliQ Hardware is a rapidly growing company facing challenges with Excel-based analytics, leading to significant financial losses, particularly in Latin America. This project aims to provide AtliQ with a robust data analytics solution using Power BI, delivering:

Customized Profit & Loss (P&L) reports
In-depth financial, sales, marketing, and supply chain insights
Executive summaries for decision-making
Problem Statement
The expansion of AtliQ Hardware exposed gaps in their data analytics capabilities, with Excel becoming cumbersome and inefficient. This lack of dynamic insights contributed to financial losses, especially in Latin America. The goal was to implement a comprehensive data analytics system to enable actionable insights and data-driven decision-making.
